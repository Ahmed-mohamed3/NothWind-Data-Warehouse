# ETL Project: Elevating Data for Informed Decision-Making

Welcome to my ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) project repository! This project represents a significant milestone in my journey to harness the power of data engineering for better decision-making.

## Project Overview

In this project, I undertook the task of extracting, transforming, and loading data from two distinct data sources. Here's a breakdown of the key phases and accomplishments:

### Data Extraction

I meticulously extracted data from two diverse data sources using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). This initial step laid the foundation for the entire project.

### Staging Area Transformation

The extracted data underwent extensive transformations in the staging area. I implemented advanced data cleaning techniques to eliminate duplicates and ensure data quality. Additionally, I introduced key driver columns and performed data type conversions to prepare the data for downstream processing.

### Data Warehousing

To facilitate efficient data storage and retrieval, I designed and established a robust Data Warehouse. This served as the central repository for our refined data, enabling easy access for analytical purposes.

### Fact and Dimension Tables

Within the Data Warehouse, I meticulously crafted two fact tables and four dimension tables. These tables were essential in structuring our data for analytical queries and reporting.

### Multidimensional Cube Creation

Leveraging SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), I constructed a Multidimensional Cube. This cube served as a crucial element in our business intelligence architecture, empowering our analysis team to generate comprehensive reports and derive valuable insights.
